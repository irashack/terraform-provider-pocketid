# Maintenance fork v2.3.1 — 2026-09-06

Based on upstream v2.3.0. Backports PR #97 with original contributor attribution.

- Select the singular/plural client-secret endpoint using validated semantic versions.
- Reject invalid version responses; legacy fallback requires a verified missing route.
- Do not automatically retry mutations or follow redirects with an API key.
- Preserve known client identity after uncertainty or failed cleanup; report rollback
  honestly. Refuse fixed-ID creation when an existing object is found.
- Remove HTTP request/response bodies and arbitrary server errors from diagnostics/logs.
- Preserve resource schemas, import IDs and create-only secret behavior.
- Publish under the fork's own identity with native mirror installation. Registry
  publication is pending; checksums are provided and archives are unsigned.

See TESTING.md for official-image results and deferred application-configuration
acceptance failures, CONTRIBUTING.md for upstream reconciliation, and upstream's
[release history](https://github.com/Trozz/terraform-provider-pocketid/releases)
for changes through v2.3.0.
